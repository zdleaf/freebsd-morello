.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm iwlwifi
.Nd Intel IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax wireless network driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To load the driver as a module at boot time, place the following lines in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
if_iwlwifi_load="YES"
.Ed
.Pp
The driver should automatically load any
.Xr iwlwififw 4
firmware needed for the particular chipset.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver is derived from Intel's Linux iwlwifi driver and provides support for
all chipsets supported by the
.Em mvm
part of that driver.
This superseeds the
.Xr iwm 4
driver which provided support for a subset of these chipsets and still
complements the
.Xr iwn 4
driver supporting older chipsets.
.Pp
The driver uses the
.\" No LinuxKPI man pages so no .Xr here.
.Em linuxkpi_wlan
and
.Em linuxkpi
compat framework to bridge between the Linux and
native FreeBSD driver code.
.Pp
While
.Nm
supports all 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax
the compatibility code currently only supports 802.11 a/b/g modes.
Support for 802.11 n/ac is to come. 802.11ax and 6Ghz support are planned.
.Sh BUGS
Certainly.
